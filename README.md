# PeptASiDe
PEPTidase Active SIte DEtector/DEsigner

*** Building up (slowly)! Functionality is very limited!! ***

* *Idea:* *
The idea is to provide tools to analyze the topology of active sites of peptidases. Based on this knowledge, I want to apply search and design approaches.

## Getting started
Copy the whole repository and either run the applications in `apps` or create your own applications. Alternatively, copy only `src` and optionally applications from `apps` and create your own structure.

When you have copied the whole repository, you can simply run the applications with your own or with default parameters, or you load the respective `.config`files as follows:

```
python createPeptidaseActiveSiteCSV.py @../data/configs/createPeptidaseActiveSiteCSV.config
```
